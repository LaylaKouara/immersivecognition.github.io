# Profile

I gained my Mechanical Engineering MEng from the University of Leeds in 2016.

# Research interests

I work as a research assistant on the Human-Like Computing project. By using Virtual Reality we aim to investigate how humans make decisions when interacting with cluttered environments, like a fridge shelf. By studying human behaviour in these scenarios we hope to inform robotics research in the area and make robotic decision making more understandable to humans.
