Experiments 1 to 4 used click trains, flickering squares, expanding circles, and white noise as pre-stimulus events and showed that (a) periodic clicks appeared to “speed up” the pacemaker of an internal clock but that the effect wore off over a click-free delay, (b) aperiodic click trains, and visual stimuli in the form of flickering squares and expanding circles, also produced similar increases in estimated tone duration, as did white noise, although its effect was weaker. A fifth experiment examined the effects of periodic flicker on reaction time and showed that, as with periodic clicks in a previous experiment, reaction times were shorter when preceded by flicker than without."

        "abstract": "A classic effect in the timing field is that “sounds are judged longer than lights”(Goldstone, Boardman & Lhamon, 1959). Recently, judgements for tactile durations have been found to fall between the two (Jones, Poliakoff & Wells, 2009). These modality differences are commonly interpreted within scalar timing theory as the work of a central pacemaker which runs faster for sounds, then vibrations, and slowest for lights (Wearden, Edwards, Fakhri & Percival, 1998). We investigated whether verbal estimates and temporal difference thresholds are correlated within each modality, but found this not to be the case. This suggests that differences in pacemaker speed may not be the main driver for modality differences in thresholds. In addition, we investigated sensory bias as an alternative to the pacemaker explanation, but this was found not to correlate with modality differences in timing.",

We tested this explanation according to three research aims. First, we replicated the threshold and estimation tasks of Jones, Poliakoff, and Wells (Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 62, 2171–2186, 2009) and found the well-documented greater precision for auditory than visual intervals, and for filled than for empty intervals.

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training. The aim of this work was to test the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers was also compared to establish construct validity. Overall, the results demonstrated that the simulation was able to distinguish novices from experts, and provided task demands comparable to real putting.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) systems hold significant potential for both training and experimentation purposes as they provide precise control over the environment and the possibility to untether tasks from their normal physical constraints. However, the artificial creation of depth in stereoscopic displays, and reduced availability of haptic information, may affect how visually-guided motor tasks are performed in the virtual world. If so, tasks learned in VR may be unrepresentative of real skills, and therefore unlikely to elicit positive transfer to the real-world. In Experiment 1 we tested whether learning a visually-guided motor skill (golf putting) in virtual reality could transfer to real-world improvements. Despite the perceptual limitations imposed by the virtual environment, training novice golfers in VR led to improvements in real putting that were comparable to real-world practice. Experiment 2 explored these effects in more skilled golfers, and examined changes in gaze behaviour (quiet eye) that resulted from the more immediate use of VR (ie as a tool for ‘warming up’). VR use was found to cause impairments to gaze control (quiet eye) and putting accuracy, when used immediately prior to real world putting. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential for VR training, but also highlight that fundamental questions remain about how the altered perceptual environment of VR affects visually-guided skills.",

The same researcher might wish to collect such data with hundreds of participants outside the laboratory, and the use of a VR headset makes this a realistic proposition.

This question is important because of the emphasis placed on developing important new manual skills during this period of a child's education (e.g. writing, drawing, using computers). We investigated age and sex-differences in the ability of 422 children to control a handheld stylus. A task battery deployed using tablet PC technology presented interactive visual targets on a computer screen whilst simultaneously recording participant's objective kinematic responses, via their interactions with the on-screen stimuli using the handheld stylus. The battery required children use the stylus to: (i) make a series of aiming movements, (ii) trace a series of abstract shapes and (iii) track a moving object. The tasks were not familiar to the children, allowing measurement of a general ability that might be meaningfully labelled ‘manual control’, whilst minimising culturally determined differences in experience (as much as possible). A reliable interaction between sex and age was found on the aiming task, with girls' movement times being faster than boys in younger age groups (e.g. 4–5 years) but with this pattern reversing in older children (10–11 years). The improved performance in older boys on the aiming task is consistent with prior evidence of a male advantage for gross-motor aiming tasks, which begins to emerge during adolescence. A small but reliable sex difference was found in tracing skill, with girls showing a slightly higher level of performance than boys irrespective of age. There were no reliable sex differences between boys and girls on …",

We found that baseline performance in 3D tracing and drawing co-varied with the visual perception (VP) component of the Beery.

Published work on similar pre-existing computerised systems is discussed and arguments made for these alternative systems being equal, if not superior, in terms of their innovativeness. The commentary does not dispute the usefulness of systems such as the one described by Lee et al. Rather, in the interests of scholarship it provides an accompanying insight into the significant scholarly contributions previously, and contemporaneously, being made by other research groups working in this area."

The implications of impaired performance are obvious in the case of minimally invasive surgery (MIS). MIS has revolutionized medicine with greatly improved patient outcome postoperatively. MIS is recommended by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and is particularly beneficial in the cases of upper and lower gastrointestinal cancers and bariatric surgery. MIS is associated with many benefits to the patient such as reduced pain, shorter (if any) hospital stays, reduced wound infection rates, and a decreased risk of operative and 30-day mortality (Cuschieri, 1995). There is also a lower risk of longer-term …"

Poling problems were therefore encountered for the majority of the materials investigated due to the unfavourable resistivity mismatch.

The argument is presented that, to warrant the use of the term virtual environment (VE), the display should satisfy criteria that arise from the nature of human spatial perception. It directly follows, therefore, that perceptual criteria are the foundations of an effective VE display. We address the task of making a VE system easy to navigate, traverse and engage, by examining the ways in which three-dimensional perception and perception of motion may be supported, and consider the potential conflict that may arise between depth cues. We propose that the design of VE …"

We undertook research to determine the effect of stereoscopic depth in virtual reality displays on the visual system and found that stereoscopic depth does not, per se, cause problems to binocular vision over short (10-min) viewing periods. However, 10 min of viewing a display that required constant ocular focus with changing vergence eye movements was sufficient to cause deficits of binocular vision.",

This paper is concerned with a potential source of visual stress that has not been previously considered with regard to VR systems: inappropriate vertical gaze angle. As vertical gaze angle is raised or lowered the ‘effort’ required of the binocular system also changes. The extent to which changes in vertical gaze angle alter the demands placed upon the vergence eye movement system was explored. The results suggested that visual stress may depend, in part, on vertical gaze angle.

It was found that ocular position dominates limb proprioception in the judgement of finger distance in the sagittal plane when vision is available. In contrast, an increase in perceived egocentric distance was largely attenuated by the presence of limb proprioception in reduced visual cue conditions. We conclude that the relative contribution of vergence to perceived distance depends upon the strength of the vergence effort signal when there are other cues present. Furthermore, if the distance percept includes a major contribution from retinal cues, then the visual component will dominate the limb proprioception component.

The first part of the paper outlines the framework [the cyclopean equilibrium point (EP) model] and considers the binoculus or cyclopean eye from the perspective of a current account of motor control (the EP hypothesis).

Problems may occur due to impairment at a range of levels (eg neurological, orthopaedic or physiological). Problems with manual control may arise through a defined neurological condition, as an associated feature of a childhood syndrome, or as a developmental disorder in the absence of overt neurological signs. Some childhood disorders, such as autism, have poor manual control as one feature within a complex clinical picture, while in other cases a difficulty with manual control may occur along with a primary deficit which appears to lie outside the motor domain (eg a specific reading or attention disorder). Manual problems may differ not only in their aetiology but also in their time frame. Some problems are acute, while others follow a chronic course and may or may not be progressive. The lack of standardization regarding what constitutes adequate manual control and how we classify children as exhibiting “coordination difficulties’ leaves the area of study altogether too diffuse. Despite the problems of delineating the boundaries of manual control difficulties it is generally recognized that poor manual control may adversely affect general development. Gross impairment of manual function in cerebral palsy (CP) places considerable restrictions on the child's general exploration and acquisition of basic manual skills. Less profound problems may also be of general consequence and hinder the development of more complex control skills such as handwriting or everyday tasks such as dressing …"

We used a perturbation technique to explore the contribution of vergence to visually based distance estimates as a function of both fixation distance and the availability of retinal information.

When additional depth and distance cues are added, the contribution of vergence information becomes more complicated.

The children with DCD in this study were significantly poorer than control children on all matching tasks. They seemed to have particular difficulty in cross-modal judgements that required the use of visual information to guide proprioceptive judgements of limb position. A distinction is drawn between tasks that can be achieved purely through sensory matching and those that require body-centred spatial judgements, suggesting that it is the latter that posits a particular difficulty for children with DCD.",

In principle, prehension might be more accurate with binocular rather than monocular vision. Previous studies have shown that the kinematics of prehension are altered when one eye is covered. Unfortunately, the source of the useful binocular information cannot be established using this approach. In the current study, we used a perturbation technique to explore whether the human nervous system uses a signal from vergence in prehension. Perturbing vergence caused predictable changes in the kinematics of prehension. Our results thus provide clear evidence that the nervous system uses vergence information in the programming of prehensile movement."

If this is correct then it challenges a widely accepted account (modified weak fusion) of how the nervous system combines multiple sources of information. We hypothesised that the influence of perceived size on the perception of distance is likely to be restricted to conscious perceptual judgements. If our hypothesis is correct then the size-distance paradox should not be observed when observers make action-based distance judgements. In line with this expectation we observed the size-distance paradox when participants made verbal reports on target distance but found no paradoxical judgements in a group who were asked to point at the target.

The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which blur-driven accommodation can provide information on target distance in the absence of any retinal cues to distance. Observers were extremely accurate when carrying out the pointing task in a ‘fullcue’ condition. In contrast, observers were extremely poor at carrying out the task when accommodation was the only distance cue available. Responses on individual trials bore little relationship to the actual target distance in any of the observers. On the other hand, accommodation weakly biased the mean responses in some observers. This bias appears to be due to the observers' effective use of accommodation to determine whether the target presented in one trial was nearer or further away than the target presented in the previous trial …",

It is not clear whether the decrease in the use of size information was accelerated by the presence of a cue conflict or whether the fall represents the normal shift towards the use of a memory-based representation for programming grip force.

Our data strongly favoured the traditional visuomotor channel hypothesis and demonstrated that the time taken to grasp an object in the presence of obstacles was well predicted by a Fitts' law relationship. We suggest a \"third-way\" hypothesis in order to retain the advantages of the digit channel hypothesis within the visuomotor framework.

Whether these ratios are stable entities, genetically determined, or modifiable by experience has been the subject of some debate.

        "abstract": " Structural learning suggests that the human nervous system learns general rules that can be applied when controlling actions involving similar structures (e.g. using a variety of bicycles when learning to ride). These general rules can then facilitate skill acquisition in novel but related situations (e.g. a new bicycle). We tested this concept by investigating whether learned asymmetries in handwriting (greater ease in moving the hand rightwards and downwards within Western-educated populations) are present in the non-preferred hand as predicted by structural learning. We found these asymmetries in both hands of a right-handed population when tracing abstract shapes. We then ruled out biomechanical explanations by finding the same results with a left-handed population. These findings provide support for structural learning and explain: (1) the rapidity with which individuals can learn to write with their …",

It has been shown that removing binocular vision affects (negatively) both the planning and on-line control of prehension. It has been suggested that the adverse impact of removing binocular vision is because monocular viewing results in an underestimation of target distance in visuomotor tasks. This suggestion is based on the observation that the kinematics of prehension are altered when viewing monocularly. We argue that it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions regarding the accuracy of distance perception from these data. In experiment 1, we found data that contradict the idea that a consistent visuomotor underestimation of target distance is an inevitable consequence of monocular viewing. Our data did show, however, that positional variance increases under monocular viewing. We provide an …",

In the present study we have tested this idea more directly, and found no evidence to support such a distinction.

VR systems are potentially powerful tools for studying perception in prehension as they afford precise control over all visual information and allow one to perturb the information in ways that are restricted by Newtonian laws within the physical world. Nonetheless, VR systems do not appear to have fully realised their potential. One major reason for the limitations of VR in prehension research is that people do not appear to show the same levels of performance when reaching-to-grasp virtual items as they evidence when grasping physical objects. One possible explanation for reduced performance in unnatural prehension tasks hinges around the need for the nervous system to …"

        "abstract": "  One possible source of information regarding the distance of a fixated target is provided by the height of the object within the visual scene. It is accepted that this cue can provide ordinal information, but generally it has been assumed that the nervous system cannot extract \"absolute\" information from height-in-scene. In order to use height-in-scene, the nervous system would need to be sensitive to ocular position with respect to the head and to head orientation with respect to the shoulders (i.e. vertical gaze angle or VGA). We used a perturbation technique to establish whether the nervous system uses vertical gaze angle as a distance cue. Vertical gaze angle was perturbed using ophthalmic prisms with the base oriented either up or down. In experiment 1, participants were required to carry out an open-loop pointing task whilst wearing: (1) no prisms; (2) a base-up prism; or (3) a base-down prism. In …",

The time it takes one hand to move to a target in a simple aiming task can be predicted reliably from Fitts' law, which states that movement time is a function of a combined measure of amplitude and accuracy constraints (the index of difficulty, ID). It has been assumed previously that Fitts' law is violated in bimanual aiming movements to targets of unequal ID. We present data from two experiments to show that this assumption is incorrect: if the attention demands of a bimanual aiming task are constant then the movements are well described by a Fitts' law relationship. Movement time therefore depends not only on ID but on other task conditions, which is a basic feature of Fitts' law. In a third experiment we show that eye movements are an important determinant of the …",

Adult participants reached and grasped a cylinder positioned to require either pronation or supination of the hand. Successive cylinder positions changed either randomly or systematically between trials. Random positioning led to optimized economy of movement. In contrast, systematic changes in position biased action selection toward previously selected actions at the expense of movement economy. Thus, one switches to a new movement only when the savings outweigh the costs of the switch. Immediate movement history had an even larger influence on children aged 7-15 years. This suggests that switching costs are greater in children, which is consistent with their reduced grasping experience. The presence of this effect in adults suggests that …"

We tested this idea in two studies involving patients with visual form agnosia resulting from bilateral ventral-stream damage.

We suggest that studies investigating “imitation” must identify the level of representation required for success in the imitation task. We provide an overview of techniques for measuring skilled movement (using aiming and prehension movements as an example) and highlight the value of kinematic measurement techniques for precise quantification of imitation behavior. We discuss a study indicating that movement control per se is not necessarily impaired in ASD and speculate on why imitation deficits might lie at the heart of autism."

In both cases, participants generated trajectories within the boundaries of a delineated path. When tracing, the participants used a handheld stylus to follow a sinusoidal shape displayed on a tablet laptop. When steering, participants used a steering-wheel to change their locomotor direction to match a perspective-correct computer-generated sinusoidal roadway (see Wilkie & Wann, 2003).

The role of vision changes over the lifespan with children relying more on haptic information as they mature (Wann et al., 1998). The role of vision in the maintenance of posture is not well understood in older populations but it is possible that neuromuscular degeneration increases the reliance upon vision. Our poor understanding is particularly worrying because falls have been reported as the primary cause of premature death in older persons (Sattin, 1992). Standing balance is a reasonable predictor of increased risk of falling (Jarnlo, 2003, Winter et al., 1990). Nonetheless, many falls occur when someone is engaged in a visuomotor task (eg putting a key in a lock) rather than simply standing upright.

Postulated empirical support for this ‘ideo-motor (IM) conjecture’ typically rests upon two types of experimental paradigm (reaction time and movement tracking tasks). These paradigms purport to show movement facilitation when compatible movements are observed and vice versa, but only for biological stimuli. Unfortunately, these paradigms often contain confounding (and unavoidable) generic stimulus–response compatibility effects that are not restricted to observed human movement. The current study demonstrates in three experiments that equivalent compatibility effects can be produced by non-biological stimuli. These results suggest that existing empirical paradigms may not, and perhaps cannot, support the IM-conjecture.",

The iPAM (Intelligent Pneumatic Arm Movement) is a robotic system that aims to provide more time-efficient rehabilitation therapy. To make sure this really addresses the needs of therapists and patients, the iPAM development has involved significant input from both parties throughout its development. However, despite the generally accepted importance of user involvement in the development of rehabilitation robotics, there is still a lack of published literature in this area, and most of the reported cases only seek user opinion once a device has been developed. This paper reviews existing literature on user involvement, and discusses the approach adopted in the iPAM project. Feedback from the user tests is presented, along with a discussion of …"

A simple lawful relationship was found between the extent of rotation (pronation or supination) and duration. Reach-to-grasp movements to objects rotated in the sagittal and horizontal plane produced different movement patterns. These patterns increased the muscle level degrees of freedom recruited (higher neuromuscular demands) and movement duration increased correspondingly though not in a simple manner.

Experiment 1 pre-cued movement (allowing advanced preparation) and found no influence of distance on RT. Thus, target distance does not affect initiation time. Experiment 2 removed pre-cue information and found that preparing a movement of increased distance lengthens RT. Experiment 3 explored movements to targets of cued size at non-cued distances and found size altered peak speed and movement duration but RT was influenced by distance alone. Thus, amplitude influences preparation time (for reasons other than altered duration) but not initiation time.

Evidence supporting the case for an ideomotor theory of imitation has come from studies that show imitative responses to be faster than the same behavioural measures performed in response to spatial cues. In an attempt to replicate these findings, we manipulated the salience of the visual cue and found that we could reverse the advantage of the imitative cue over the spatial cue. We suggest that participants utilised a simple visuomotor mechanism to perform all aspects of this task, with performance being driven by the relative visual salience of the stimuli.

However, physical therapy resources are often limited, so methods of supplementing traditional physiotherapy are essential. Robot assisted physiotherapy is one way to increase the duration patients spend participating in rehabilitation activities. A single robot system has been developed at the University of Leeds that actively assists patients undertaking therapeutic movements in a three-dimensional workspace. However, using only a single point of contact at the wrist to assist with therapeutic reaching movements does not allow control or support of the more proximal joints of the upper limb. This could lead to discomfort during assisted exercise. In addition, the design suffers from a restrictive workspace, limiting the range of …"

Nonetheless, normal unimanual prehension behaviour predicts asynchrony when the two hands reach towards unequal targets, with synchrony restricted to targets equal in size and distance. Additionally, sufficiently separated targets require sequential looking. Does synchrony occur in all cases because it is preferred in bimanual coordination or does asynchrony occur because of unimanual task constraints and the need for sequential looking? We investigated coordinative timing when participants (n = 8) moved their right (preferred) hand to the same object at a fixed distance but the left hand to objects of different width (3, 5, and 7 cm) and grip surface size (1, 2, and 3 cm) placed at different distances …",

Crucially, our design explored post-adaptation effects rather than the previously documented role of haptic information in movement organisation. A post-adaptation reach-to-grasp task showed: (1) distorted haptic feedback caused recalibration; (2) reach distance and grasp size could be calibrated separately but, if calibrated simultaneously, then (3) recalibration was greater when distance and size changed in a consistent (e.g. reaching for a larger object at a greater …",

Children with DCD found the task difficult and the apparatus was modified accordingly (decreased postural and force production demands). The distracter affected some children with DCD and some found it difficult to stop. All of the DCD population showed poorer performance in both the perturbation and non-perturbation condition.

Nevertheless, reductions in speed and accuracy can also reflect compensation as well as deficit. We used a manual tracing and a driving task to identify generalized spatial and temporal compensations and deficits associated with old age. In Experiment 1, participants used a hand-held stylus to trace a path. In Experiment 2, participants steered along paths in a virtual reality driving simulator. In both experiments, participants were required to stay within the boundaries while we manipulated task difficulty by changing path width or movement speed.

Corner cutting effectively reduces the curvature of bends but yields a greater risk of error (ie, clipping the path or road edge). Corner cutting is thus less risky on wider paths, and we found that …",

        "abstract": " Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has heralded a revolution in surgical practice, with numerous advantages over open surgery. Nevertheless, it prevents the surgeon from directly touching and manipulating tissue and therefore severely restricts the use of valuable techniques such as palpation. Accordingly a key challenge in MIS is to restore haptic feedback to the surgeon. This paper reviews the state‐of‐the‐art in laparoscopic palpation devices (LPDs) with particular focus on device mechanisms, sensors and data analysis. It concludes by examining the challenges that must be overcome to create effective LPD systems that measure and display haptic information to the surgeon for improved intraoperative assessment.

Such specialisation allows a higher level of skill to be maintained in the preferred hand on specific tasks through continuous practice and performance. Hand asymmetries might be expected to increase with age because of the time spent practising with the preferred hand. However, neurophysiological work has suggested reduced hemispheric function lateralisation in the ageing brain, and behavioural studies have found reduced motor asymmetries in older adults (Przybyla et al., in Neurosci Lett 489:99–104, 2011). We therefore tested the predictions of behavioural change from reduced hemispheric function by measuring tracing performance (arguably one of the most lateralised of human behaviours) along paths of different thickness in a group of healthy young and older adults.

We explored whether altering object texture would produce qualitative changes in the form of the precontact movement patterns. Twelve participants reached to lift objects from a tabletop. Nine objects were produced, each with one of three grip surface textures (high-friction, medium-friction and low-friction) and one of three widths (50 mm, 70 mm and 90 mm). Each object was placed at three distances (100 mm, 300 mm and 500 mm), representing a total of 27 trial conditions. We observed two distinct movement patterns across all trials—participants either: (i) brought their arm to a stop, secured the object and lifted it from the tabletop; or (ii) grasped the object ‘on-the-fly’, so it was secured in the hand while the arm was moving. A majority of grasps were on-the-fly when the texture was high-friction and none when the object was low-friction, with medium-friction producing an intermediate proportion. Previous research has shown that the probability of on-the-fly behaviour is a function of grasp surface accuracy constraints. A finger friction rig was used to calculate the coefficients of friction for the objects and these calculations showed that the area available for a stable grasp (the ‘functional grasp surface size’) increased with surface friction coefficient. Thus, knowledge of functional grasp surface size is required to predict the probability of observing a given qualitative form of grasping in human prehensile behaviour.",

Visual capture can produce powerful illusory effects with individuals misjudging the size and position of their hands. The advent of laparoscopic surgical techniques raises the question of whether visual capture can interfere with an individual's rate of motor learning. We compared adaptation to distorted visual feedback in two groups: the Direct group appeared to have the advantage of directly viewing the input device, while the Indirect group used the same input device but viewed their movements on a remote screen. Counterintuitively, the Indirect group adapted more readily to distorted feedback and showed enhanced performance.

In order to test between these alternatives, we created an experimental tool that connected a commercially available robotic arm with specialised software that presents visual stimuli and objectively records kinematics.

In the current study, we tested practice using such active movements as compared to practice using passive movement. The passive movement employed, namely haptic tracking, provided a strong test of the comparison, one that showed that the mere inaction of the muscles is not the problem.

Older participants showed quantitative differences to their younger counterparts – movements were slower and peak speed did not scale with object distance. There were also qualitative differences with older adults showing a greater propensity to stop the hand and adjust finger position before lifting objects. The older participants particularly struggled to lift wide slippery objects, apparently due to an inability to manipulate their grasp to provide the level of precision necessary to functionally enclose the object.

One index of reduced performance is increased movement duration caused by the necessity for visual feedback error correction. Visual feedback correction mechanisms use cognitive resources, thus we conjectured that working memory capacity will be reached more quickly when sequence elements require more visual correction. Methods: Specialist software presented visual stimuli and recorded movement kinematics.

In the current experiments, we investigated the effect of altering effectivities (relevant actor properties) by restricting (Experiment 1) or extending (Experiment 2) MGS.Method: Participants reached quickly for objects that varied in object-width (3, 5, 7cm) and contact-surface-size (1, 2, 3cm), thus in MOE.

This decoupling of motoric workspace and visual display creates distorted visuomotor mappings which varies with camera and port position: when the port position is changed, different limb movements and forces are required to elicit the same visual outcome (the tools are 1 [sup] st [/sup] order sliding levers). It has been shown that exposure to a variety of visuomotor distortions improves learning of novel visuomotor mappings (Braun et al., 2009), however, it is not clear whether this finding generalises to the laparoscopic surgical environment.

It therefore appears that facial expression may influence behaviour to a greater extent under the effects of alcohol.

This raises the question of how sensitive is DF to looming information that ordinarily signals object approach and time to collision (TTC)? We first established that DF has a reasonable ability to catch a ball that is thrown to her in a straightforward fashion. We next presented DF with a range of looming and changing size stimuli.

An alternative explanation, however, is that hand differences are subtle, and capturing them requires tasks that yield optimal performance with both hands. Whereas the hemispheric specialisation account implies that reduced manual asymmetries should be reliably observed in older adults, the ‘measurement difficulty’ account suggests that manual asymmetries will be hard to detect unless a task has just the right level of difficulty—i.e. within the ‘Goldilocks Zone’, where it is not too easy or too hard, but just right. Experiment One tested this hypothesis and found that manual asymmetries were only detected when participants performed in this zone; specifically, performance on a tracing task was only superior in the preferred hand when task constraints were high (i.e. fast speed tracing). Experiment Two used three different tasks to examine age differences in manual asymmetries; one task produced no asymmetries, whilst two tasks revealed asymmetries in both younger and older groups (with poorer overall performance in the old group across all tasks). Experiment Three revealed task-dependent asymmetries in both age groups, but highlighted further detection difficulties linked with the metric of performance and compensatory strategies used by participants. Results are discussed with reference to structural learning theory, whereby we suggest that the processes of inter-manual transfer lead to relatively small performance differences between the hands (despite a …",

        "abstract": "The assessment of tissue compliance using a handheld tool is an important skill in medical areas such as laparoscopic and dental surgery. The increasing prevalence of virtual reality devices raises the question of whether we can exploit these systems to accelerate the training of compliance discrimination in trainee surgeons. We used a haptic feedback device and stylus to assess the abilities of naïve participants to detect compliance differences with and without knowledge of results (KR) (groups 1 and 2), as well as the abilities of participants who had undergone repetitive training over several days (group 3). Kinematic analyses were carried out to objectively measure the probing action. Untrained participants had poor detection thresholds (mean just noticeable difference, JND = 33%), and we found no effect of KR (provided after each trial) on performance (mean JND = 35%). Intensive training dramatically …",

        "abstract": "Numerous activities require an individual to respond quickly to the correct stimulus. The provision of advance information allows response priming but heightened responses can cause errors (responding too early or reacting to the wrong stimulus). Thus, a balance is required between the online cognitive mechanisms (inhibitory and anticipatory) used to prepare and execute a motor response at the appropriate time. We investigated the use of advance information in 71 participants across four different age groups: (i) children, (ii) young adults, (iii) middle-aged adults, and (iv) older adults. We implemented ‘cued’ and ‘non-cued’ conditions to assess age-related changes in saccadic and touch responses to targets in three movement conditions: (a) Eyes only; (b) Hands only; (c) Eyes and Hand. Children made less saccade errors compared to young adults, but they also exhibited longer response times in cued versus non-cued conditions. In contrast, older adults showed faster responses in cued conditions but exhibited more errors. The results indicate that young adults (18–25 years) achieve an optimal balance between anticipation and execution. In contrast, children show benefits (few errors) and costs (slow responses) of good inhibition when preparing a motor response based on advance information; whilst older adults show the benefits and costs associated with a prospective response strategy (i.e., good anticipation).",

Adults slowed their movements and decreased their maximum grip aperture when an obstacle was positioned close to a target object (the effect declined as the distance between target and obstacle increased). The children showed the same pattern, but the magnitude of the effect was quite different.

Finite Element Analysis is a useful technique for engineering physical objects, but optimal design must be informed by how the human interacts with objects. Our group is attempting to model the control of hand movements in order to create CAD packages that allow object design to be informed by an individual’s sensorimotor control strategies (Prehensile Control Analysis). Prehension, the ability to reach-grasp-and-manipulate objects, is one of the most important human capabilities. Numerous activities of daily living (dressing, feeding, cleaning etc.) rely on dexterity, so it is perhaps unsurprising that impairment of prehension (through illness, injury or ageing decline) is often associated with disability. The kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements show high levels of stereotypicality in neurologically intact adults whilst impairment …"

With the arrival of fast, pixel array detectors on all the MX beamlines at Diamond, the data collection times have reduced considerably and the number of samples being studied per eight hour shift has more than doubled in the past five years (Fig. 1). Consequently there has been a drive to increase the capacity and efficiency of the sample changers.Since January, a new robotic sample changer has been operational on beamline I03. The new robot, BART (Fig. 2), has improved exchange times, increased sample capacity significantly and is more tightly integrated into the beamline control systems which means reliability has also improved."

It can have a significant long-term social and academic impact on sufferers [3]. The role of specific brain areas in DCD has long been postulated from psychometric studies, with particular evidence for the cerebellum [4] and parietal lobe [5] amongst others. However, the underlying aetiology of the disease remains poorly understood. Most studies of DCD have been restricted to behavioural or physiologic measurements; there are no existing structural imaging studies of DCD. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to use structural magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the hypothesis that DCD has neural correlates that can be seen in brain morphometry.",

The primary outcome of this study is surgical performance (Competency Assessment tool) and the secondary is patient outcomes. Pilot data: As “proof of concept” surgical performance after SMR with 3D models and after watching a didactic video was compared. Surgeons who performed SMR using a 3D model performed significantly better (number of movements-553 vs. 1391.5, p= 0.005, total path length of instrument tip 1540.24 vs. 2837 p= 0.007 and time 667 s, vs. 1283s, p= 0.003). Forward plan: Patient specific SMR with the use of 3D models, is expected to increase quality of surgery and specimen and reduce operative complications. The results of this study will create a strong impetus for widespread use of patient-specific SMR.

Previously, we developed a training method that supports active movement generation to allow improvement at a 3D tracing task requiring good compliance control. Here, we tested 7–8 year old children from several 2nd grade classrooms to determine whether 3D tracing performance could be predicted using the Beery VMI. We also examined whether 3D tracing training lead to improvements in drawing. Baseline testing included Beery, a drawing task on a tablet computer, and 3D tracing. We found that baseline performance in 3D tracing and drawing co-varied with the visual perception (VP) component of the Beery. Differences in 3D tracing between children scoring low versus high on the Beery VP replicated differences previously found between children with and without motor impairments, as did post-training performance that eliminated these differences. Drawing improved as a result of training in the 3D tracing task. The training method improved drawing and reduced differences predicted by Beery scores."

        "abstract": "Whilst social and communication impairments represent the defining features of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), the proposed comorbidity between ASD and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; Leyfer, 2006) suggests attentional deficits may also be an underlying feature of ASD. The DSM-IV-TR precludes a dual-diagnosis of ASD with ADHD and symptoms of attention deficits are not included in the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10 diagnosis for ASD. There is currently inconsistent literature surrounding what types of attentional difficulties exist in ASD, if any. As undiagnosed ASDs are suspected to be a leading cause of expulsion from schools (Skuse et al, 2010), the present study aims to explore sustained and divided attentional abilities as they are known to have a relationship with academic performance (Gordon et al, 1994), in children across a continuum of autistic spectrum disorder traits, using a novel objective measure of attention. 80 children (M= 40, F= 40, aged 7-11) were recruited from a primary school in the ‘Born in Bradford’cohort. Sustained attention was measured on tracking and cue-detection tasks on a tablet laptop, and divided attention was measured by performing both tasks together under dual-task conditions. Information was gathered for each child from their main teacher using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman et al, 2001); three subscales of which have previously been found to represent ASD traits (Iizuka et al, 2010; Russell et al, 2012). Results revealed that sustained and divided attention capacity does appear to be poorer in children who display greater ASD traits. Linear regressions suggest …",

Its effects and severity can be extremely varied, but a combination of arm impairments through weakness or spasticity and sensory deficits is common and can (i) significantly impair the ability of individuals with CP to carry out daily activities and (ii) create significant social barriers (Imms, 2008). Therapy is often used to aid the acquisition of motor skills, particularly in childhood, but a lack of physiotherapy resources means that this is often delivered through a self-managed home exercise programme. Exercises are frequently dull and repetitive, and children often lack the motivation to carry out these exercises, leading to poor compliance with the prescribed plan (Chappell and Williams, 2002)."

The tasks provided objective performance measures that tested previous claims based on subjective observations regarding autism. We found that children with autism: (i) were indistinguishable from controls in their form and motion coherence thresholds; (ii) were indistinguishable in their ability to detect subtle changes in realistic dynamic face stimuli; (iii) were indistinguishable in an imitation task requiring tracking a simple rhythmic movement; (iv) showed idiosyncratic differences in a joint attention task. In the joint attention task, targets moved around four corners of a screen during a 90 s video. Three conditions were explored: (i) a technician's head displayed in the middle of the screen (baseline); (ii) the head moved congruently with target position; (iii) the head moved incongruently. The movement execution of the autistic group was indistinguishable from the controls but there were differences in reaction time. The children with autism fell into one of three groups: (i) normal; (ii) slower RT with congruent head movement; (iii) slower RT with incongruent head movement. We suggest that 'sticky attention' in autism can reconcile our laboratory findings with clinical observations."

A number of studies have demonstrated changes in the kinematics of prehension when binocular vision is removed. Complementary studies have begun to explore what binocular information is used and how this information is exploited by the human nervous system. The present series of experiments was conducted in order to explore further when binocular information is advantageous in prehension. Three experiments were employed which varied binocular/monocular viewing in selectively lit conditions. Our research suggests that the nature of the advantage conferred by binocular vision depends upon task conditions. One constant advantage of binocular vision appears to be in its provision of on-line information regarding the position of the hand relative to the target.

It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions, however, due to differences across studies that have typically used small samples of children over large age ranges."

        "abstract": "No unique ophthalmic features are associated with Down syndrome (DS). On the other hand, the prevalence of ophthalmic disorders in people with DS is far higher when comparisons are made with general population norms (eg, Woodhouse, 1998). It is widely accepted that the primary purpose of vision is to enable action—it may be possible to have perception without action (see Milner & Goodale, 1995), but it is not possible to have skilled (learned) action in the absence of perception. If vision is one of the primary senses that underpins skilled movement, then it seems reasonable to posit that deficits in movement may be linked to ocular dysfunction. We suggest, however, that although poor eyesight may impact motor control in people with DS, it is important to avoid the temptation of inferring a causal relation between ocular disorder and movement dysfunction. We have previously argued that a distinction must be made between processes that may underpin control (the process approach) and modules that must be implicated in coordination (Wann, Mon-Williams, & Carson, 1998). Despite the everyday nature of many tasks (eg, picking up an object), successful task completion may require a complex interaction of various skills. If we are to understand why complex skills break down, it is necessary to determine the essential components that allow for successful task completion. It is also necessary to assess what information is perceptually available to someone demonstrating poor movement control in order to determine whether a poorly coordinated movement is an adequate response to inadequate information, an inadequate response to …"

Specific attention is paid to the response of the accommodation system with its cross-links to vergence eye movements, and to the spatial errors that arise when portraying three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional window.  It is suggested that these factors prevent large depth intervals of three-dimensional visual space being rendered with integrity through dual two-dimensional arrays."

But what factors drive such improvements and how should a warm-up be implemented?Methods: In order to address these issues, we adopted a two-pronged approach:(i) we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify existing studies utilizing preoperative simulation techniques; and (ii) performed task analysis to identify the constituent parts of effective warm-ups. We identified five randomised control trials, four randomised crossover trials and four case series. The majority of these studies reviewed surgical performance following preoperative simulation relative to performance without simulation.Results: Four studies reported outcome measures in real patients and the remainder reported simulated outcome measures. All but one of the studies found that preoperative simulation improves operative outcomes-but this improvement was not found across all measured parameters. Whilst the reviewed studies had a number of methodological issues, the global data indicate that preoperative simulation has substantial potential to improve surgical performance. Analysis of the task characteristics of successful interventions indicated that the majority of these studies employed warm-ups that focused on the visual motor elements of surgery. However, there was no theoretical or empirical basis to inform the design of the intervention in any of these studies. Conclusions: For the potential value of preoperative simulation to be understood and realised, there is an urgent need for a more rigorous approach to the development …",

When Crum Brown combined them by overconvergence he observed stereoscopic depth. Brown’s informal observation was conveyed to David Brewster, who suggested that the drawings were produced for a stereoscope, possibly made by Giovanni Battista della Porta (1535-1615). There followed a bitter debate about the supposed stereoscopic effects that could be seen when the pictures combined. Brewster’s claims were finally dispelled when precise measurements were made of the drawings: some parts were stereoscopic and others were pseudoscopic. Brewster’s attempts to wrest the invention of the stereoscope from Wheatstone were unsuccessful.",

Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5–11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment.

Following exposure, participants completed a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) to assess for nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor disturbances. A user evaluation study of this software was conducted to explore the potential utility of this application.Results: Fifty-seven subjects completed the user testing (34 males and 23 females). Mean age was 48.5 years (range, 21–77 years). Mean acquired work experience of the 35 ophthalmologists (61.40%) included in the group was 15.46 years (range, 1–37 years). Twenty-nine participants were VR-naïve. The SSQ showed a mean total score of 5.8 (SD= 9.44) indicating that the system was well tolerated and produced minimal side effects. No difference was reported between VR-naïve participants and experienced users. Overall, immersed subjects reported an enjoyable VR-OCT presence effect.Conclusions: A usable and satisfying VR imaging technique was developed to display and interact with original OCT data.Translational Relevance: An advanced high-end VR image display method was successfully developed to provide new views and interactions in an ultra high-speed projected digital scenery using point-cloud OCT data.

This paper describes both the development of the ChARM items and response categories and its psychometric testing and further refinement using the Rasch measurement model. Methods To generate valid items for the ChARM, we collected goals of therapy specifically developed by therapists, children with cerebral palsy, and their parents for improving activity limitation of the upper limb.

We suggest that there are potentially confounding influences in standard grasping, and we introduce a novel task to regularize the direction of approach and to eliminate the influences of nearby surfaces. In six participants, we examined speed–accuracy trade-offs for prehension, manipulating the depth (in the plane of the reach), height (orthogonal to the reach), and width (the grasped dimension) of the target object independently.

But what is the influence of asymmetric contact surfaces? In Experiment 1a, participants reached-to-lift wooden blocks off a table top, with the contact locations for the thumb and index finger varying in surface size. The time taken to lift the block was driven primarily by the thumb contact surface, which showed a larger effect size for the dependent variable of movement duration than the index finger’s contact surface. In Experiment 1b participants reached-to-grasp (but not lift) the blocks. The same effect was found with duration being largely driven by contact surface size for the thumb. Experiment 2 tested whether this finding generalised to movements towards conical frusta grasped in a different plane mounted off the table top. Experiment 2 showed that movement duration again was dictated primarily by the size of the thumb’s contact surface. The thumb contact surface was the visible surface in experiments 1 and 2 so Experiment 3 explored grasping when the index finger’s contact surface was visible (participants grasped the frusta with the index finger at the top). An interaction between thumb and finger surface size was now found to determine movement duration. These findings provide the first empirical report of the impact of asymmetric contact surfaces on prehension, and may have implications for scientists who wish to model reach-to-grasp behaviours.",

To investigate this issue, we examined how the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is modulated by information briefly presented before outcome evaluation. The FRN is a brain potential time-locked to the delivery of decision feedback and it is widely thought to be sensitive to prior expectations.

The possibility that tDCS could assist in rehabilitation (eg, for paresis post-stroke) offers hope but the evidence base is incomplete, with some behavioural studies reporting no effect of tDCS on complex motor learning. Older adults who show age-related decline in movement and learning (skills which tDCS could potentially facilitate), are also under-represented within tDCS literature. To address these issues, we examined whether tDCS would improve motor sequence learning in healthy young and older adults. Methods: In Experiment One, young participants learned 32 aiming movements using their preferred (right) hand whilst receiving:(i) 30 min Anodal Stimulation of left M1;(ii) 30 min Cathodal Stimulation of right M1; or (iii) 30 min Sham. Experiment Two used a similar task, but with older adults receiving Anodal Stimulation or Sham. Results: Whilst motor learning occurred in all participants, tDCS did not improve the rate or accuracy of motor learning for either age group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the effects of tDCS may be limited to motor performance with no clear beneficial effects for motor learning. View Full-Text",

Our aim was to explore the integrity of saccadic eye movement control in developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and typically developing (TD) children (8–12 years) and assess how these children plan and inhibit saccadic responses, the principal mechanisms within visual attention control. Eye movements and touch responses were measured (separately and concurrently) in Cued and Non-Cued conditions. We found that children with DCD had similar saccade kinematics to the TD group during saccade initiation. Advance information decreased hand movement duration in both groups during Cued trials, but decrements in accuracy were significantly worse in the DCD group. In addition, children with DCD exhibited greater inhibitory errors and inaccurate fixation during the Cued trials. Thus, children with DCD were reasonably proficient in executing saccades during reflexive (Non-Cued) conditions, but showed deficits in more complex control processes involving prediction and inhibition. These findings have implications for our understanding of motor control in children with DCD.",

        "abstract": "Motor deficits are linked to a range of negative physical, social and academic consequences. Haptic robotic interventions, based on the principles of sensorimotor learning, have been shown previously to help children with motor problems learn new movements. We therefore examined whether the training benefits of a robotic system would generalise to a standardised test of ‘pen-skills’, assessed using objective kinematic measures [via the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool, CKAT]. A counterbalanced, cross-over design was used in a group of 51 children (37 male, aged 5–11 years) with manual control difficulties. Improved performance on a novel task using the robotic device could be attributed to the intervention but there was no evidence of generalisation to any of the CKAT tasks. The robotic system appears to have the potential to support motor learning, with the technology affording numerous advantages. However, the training regime may need to target particular manual skills (e.g. letter formation) in order to obtain clinically significant improvements in specific skills such as handwriting.",

        "abstract": "Background: In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the natural relationship between hand and eye is disrupted, i.e. surgeons typically control tools inserted through the patient’s abdomen while viewing the workspace on a remote monitor, which can be located in a variety of positions. This separates the location of visual feedback from the area in which a motor action is executed. Previous studies suggest that the visual display should be placed directly ahead of the surgeon (i.e. to preserve visual-motor mapping). However, the extent of the impact of this rotation on surgical performance is unknown. Methods: Eighteen participants completed an aiming task on a tablet PC within a surgical box trainer using a laparoscopic tool in a controlled simulated environment. Visual feedback was presented on a remote monitor located at 0°, ±45° and ±90°, with order randomised using the Latin Square method. Results: Movements were significantly slower when the monitor was 90° relative to midline, but spatial accuracy was unaffected by monitor position. Interestingly, the effect of reduced speed in the 90° condition was transient, decreasing over time, suggesting rapid adaptation to the rotation. Conclusions: We conclude that the angle of the visual display in the context of MIS may require a surgeon to adapt to a changed mapping between visual inputs and motor outputs. While this adaptation occurs relatively quickly, it may interfere with skilled actions (e.g. intracorporeal suturing) in complex surgical procedures.",

They ran an experiment showed participants to lean forward when thinking of the future and lean backward when thinking of the past. We aimed to explore this phenomenon further; firstly by exploring whether the knee would move in the opposite direction to the head when participants were standing (ie an automatic counterbalancing movement to avoid instability). We also applied the same methodology as reported by Miles et al.(2010) in an attempt to replicate their results. Findings demonstrated that found that the head does indeed move in the opposite direction to the knee, but more interestingly, our second experiment actually failed replicate Miles et al’s (2010) original findings. Our data strongly suggest that the sensorimotor system prioritises the maintaining of postural control postural maintenance even when a standing individual is engaged in abstract thought processes. This strategy seems the most conducive to survival, given that this approach reduces the likelihood of falls.",

        "abstract": "Attention underpins many activities integral to a child’s development. However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).",

Conventional laparoscopy has been a major advancement in staging and treatment of uterine cancers. However, technical challenges such as 2–D imaging, rigid instruments, and lack of precision and surgeon fatigue did not translate into widespread adoption of this technique. With the advent of computer–enhanced robotic telesurgery, this has dramatically changed the surgical management and staging of endometrial cancer.",

This study aimed to characterise sensorimotor control abilities in children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) and investigate their relationships with co-occurring IQ impairments and psychopathology. Fifty-four children with 22q11.2DS and 24 unaffected sibling controls, comparable in age and gender, underwent kinematic analysis of their hand movements, whilst performing a battery of three visuo-manual coordination tasks that measured their tracking, aiming and steering abilities. Additionally, standardised assessments of full-scale IQ (FSIQ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, indicative autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and anxiety disorder symptomatology were conducted. Children with 22q11.2DS showed deficits on seven of eight kinematic descriptors of movement quality across the three coordination tasks, compared to controls. Within 22q11.2DS cases, the extent of impairment on only three kinematic descriptors was significantly related to FSIQ after correction for multiple testing. Moreover, only error whilst visuo-manually tracking was nominally associated with ADHD symptom counts. Impairments in sensorimotor control are seen on a range of visuo-manual tasks in children with 22q11.2DS but the extent of these impairments are largely unrelated to the severity of other psychopathological and intellectual impairments commonly found in children with 22q11.2DS.",

To investigate hemispheric asymmetries at different processing stages (early vs. late), the prime-target inter-stimulus interval was 0 ms in Experiment 1 and was increased to 750 ms in Experiment 2. The results from both experiments demonstrated a left hemisphere advantage for processing puns triggered by non-decomposable idioms; puns motivated by decomposable idioms were processed equally fast in both hemispheres, suggesting that this type of pun induced right hemisphere involvement …"

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training. The aim of this work was to test the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers was also compared to establish construct validity. Overall, the results demonstrated that the simulation was able to distinguish novices from experts, and provided task demands comparable to real putting.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) systems hold significant potential for both training and experimentation purposes as they provide precise control over the environment and the possibility to untether tasks from their normal physical constraints. However, the artificial creation of depth in stereoscopic displays, and reduced availability of haptic information, may affect how visually-guided motor tasks are performed in the virtual world. If so, tasks learned in VR may be unrepresentative of real skills, and therefore unlikely to elicit positive transfer to the real-world. In Experiment 1 we tested whether learning a visually-guided motor skill (golf putting) in virtual reality could transfer to real-world improvements. Despite the perceptual limitations imposed by the virtual environment, training novice golfers in VR led to improvements in real putting that were comparable to real-world practice. Experiment 2 explored these effects in more skilled golfers, and examined changes in gaze behaviour (quiet eye) that resulted from the more immediate use of VR (ie as a tool for ‘warming up’). VR use was found to cause impairments to gaze control (quiet eye) and putting accuracy, when used immediately prior to real world putting. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential for VR training, but also highlight that fundamental questions remain about how the altered perceptual environment of VR affects visually-guided skills.",

Fifty-four patients (27 with dyslexia, 27 controls) underwent extensive optometric testing. Measurements included visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, accommodation, and binocular vision testing. There was a higher proportion of individuals with dyslexia presenting with optometric problems compared to controls. For children, the most common diagnoses were hypermetropia and accommodation insufficiency. The results strongly suggest that an optometric examination should be included in the management of dyslexia."

In rehabilitation robotics, it is important to consider the user needs and requirements of such a device early in its design phase. This study demonstrates how the assessment of user needs participate in the design of a wearable robot for the rehabilitation of Filipino and Asian patients. A review of existing devices and their design features was presented to rehabilitation doctors from the Philippine General Hospital which was followed by an interview about their own experiences during therapy. The results of the discussion were translated into a list of user requirements for wearable robots in neurorehabilitation. After which, corresponding importance ratings from both the design engineers and their medical collaborators were assigned to arrive with a matrix that determines the final design priorities and specifications of the device.

As a general rule, people cannot produce these novel movements stably without training. This is because they are extremely poor at discriminating the perceptual information required to coordinate and control the movement, which means people require additional (augmented) feedback to learn the novel task. Extant methods (e.g. visual metronomes, Lissajous figures) work, but all involve transforming the perceptual information about the task and thus altering the perception–action task dynamic being studied. We describe and test a new method for providing online augmented coordination feedback using a neutral colour cue. This does not alter the perceptual information or the overall task dynamic, and an experiment confirms that (a) feedback is required for …",

Crucially, our design explored post-adaptation effects rather than the previously documented role of haptic information in movement organisation.

The purpose of this study was to extend that finding by examining the performance of all ages across the lifespan from the 20 s through to the 80 s to determine how learning rates change with age. We tested whether adults could learn to produce a novel coordinated rhythmic movement (90° relative phase) in a visually guided unimanual task. We determined learning rates to quantify changes in learning with age and to determine at what ages the changes occur. We found, as before, that learning rates of participants in their 70 s and 80 s were half those of participants in their 20 s. We also found a gradual slow decline in learning rate with age until approximately age 50, when there was a sudden drop to a reduced learning rate for the 60 though 80 year olds. We discuss possible causes for the “50 s cliff” in perceptuo-motor learning rates and suggest that age related deficits in perception of complex motions may be the key to understanding this result.",

Here we investigate the differences between young and older adults in a bimanual reaching task where the goal is to bring two objects together to the same location with a synchronous placement. Older (mean age 74) and young (mean age 20) adults were asked to pick up two spatially disparate objects, one in each hand, and bring them together to place them in one of three trays laid out in front of them from left to right. The results showed that the older adults were no more detrimentally affected than the young by asymmetric bimanual movements compared to symmetric ones, and both groups completed their movements in the same time. Nevertheless, compared to the young, the older adult group produced reaches characterised by higher peak velocities (although this effect was marginal), shorter hover times, and where the movement distance varied for each hand the scaling of the kinematic profile across the two limbs diverged from that found with younger participants. They then spent longer than the young in the final adjustment phase and during this phase they made more adjustments than the young, and as a result were more synchronous in terms of the final placement of the objects. It seems that the older adults produced reach movements that were designed to reach the vicinity of the tray quite rapidly, after which time they made discreet adjustments to their initial trajectories in order to exercise the precision necessary to place the objects in the tray. These findings are consistent with the idea that …",

Prehension, the ability to reach-grasp-and-manipulate objects, is one of the most important human capabilities. Numerous activities of daily living (dressing, feeding, cleaning etc.) rely on dexterity, so it is perhaps unsurprising that impairment of prehension (through illness, injury or ageing decline) is often associated with disability.

Overall, we found that during the predictable task a significant decrease in saccade latency, gain and duration was found when compared to the randomised conditions, as expected and observed previously. However, TMS stimulation in DLPFC during the delay in the predictive sequence learning task reduced this predictive …",

        "abstract": "Attention underpins many activities integral to a child’s development. However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).",

        "abstract": "Injury to the cervical spinal cord results in bilateral deficits in arm/hand function reducing functional independence and quality of life. To date little research has been undertaken to investigate control strategies of arm/hand movements following cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI). This study aimed to investigate unimanual and bimanual coordination in patients with acute cSCI using 3D kinematic analysis as they performed naturalistic reach to grasp actions with one hand, or with both hands together (symmetrical task), and compare this to the movement patterns of uninjured younger and older adults. Eighteen adults with a cSCI (mean 61.61 years) with lesions at C4-C8, with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade B to D and 16 uninjured younger adults (mean 23.68 years) and sixteen uninjured older adults (mean 70.92 years) were recruited. Participants with a cSCI produced reach-to-grasp actions which took longer, were slower, and had longer deceleration phases than uninjured participants. These differences were exacerbated during bimanual reach-to-grasp tasks. Maximal grasp aperture was no different between groups, but reached earlier by people with cSCI. Participants with a cSCI were less synchronous than younger and older adults but all groups used the deceleration phase for error correction to end the movement in a synchronous fashion. Overall, this study suggests that after cSCI a level of bimanual coordination is retained. While there seems to be a greater reliance on feedback to produce both the reach to grasp, we observed minimal disruption of the more impaired limb on the less impaired limb. This suggests that …",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of using a cycling workstation on mouse dexterity, including if and how this changed with practice. Thirty-four healthy adults were allocated to a sitting group (n = 17) or cycling group (n = 17). All participants completed standardised computer tasks on 6 occasions: baseline and final—all participants were seated; practice 1 to 4—sitting group participants were seated, cycling group participants pedalled on an under desk cycle. Three computer tasks were employed: (1) Tracking (continuous task)—participants used the mouse pointer to track a dot in a figure of 8 pattern at 3 different speeds without a guide then with a guide (2) Aiming (discrete task)—participants moved the mouse pointer to a dot which repeatedly disappeared then reappeared again in different locations, creating the outline of a pentagram (3) Steering (continuous task)—participants steered the mouse pointer around two different pathways. Accuracy was measured during the Tracking and Steering tasks as the root mean square error and penalised path accuracy respectively. Speed was measured during the Aiming task as the movement time. Data was analysed using frequentist and Bayes Factor analyses. During the continuous tasks (Tracking and Steering), accuracy was impaired among participants using the cycling workstation, both compared to their accuracy when seated and to the accuracy of participants in the sitting group. In contrast, no deficits in speed were noted among participants using the cycling work station during the discrete task (Aiming). No learning effects were observed among either group for any tasks. These findings suggest …",

        "abstract": "The duration of reach-to-grasp movements is influenced by the size of the contact surfaces, such that grasping objects with smaller contact surface areas takes longer. But what is the influence of asymmetric contact surfaces? In Experiment 1a, participants reached-to-lift wooden blocks off a table top, with the contact locations for the thumb and index finger varying in surface size. The time taken to lift the block was driven primarily by the thumb contact surface, which showed a larger effect size for the dependent variable of movement duration than the index finger’s contact surface. In Experiment 1b participants reached-to-grasp (but not lift) the blocks. The same effect was found with duration being largely driven by contact surface size for the thumb. Experiment 2 tested whether this finding generalised to movements towards conical frusta grasped in a different plane mounted off the table top. Experiment 2 showed that movement duration again was dictated primarily by the size of the thumb’s contact surface. The thumb contact surface was the visible surface in experiments 1 and 2 so Experiment 3 explored grasping when the index finger’s contact surface was visible (participants grasped the frusta with the index finger at the top). An interaction between thumb and finger surface size was now found to determine movement duration. These findings provide the first empirical report of the impact of asymmetric contact surfaces on prehension, and may have implications for scientists who wish to model reach-to-grasp behaviours.",
