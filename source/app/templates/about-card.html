    The Immersive Cognition Laboratory
</h1>
<p class="about">
    The Immersive Cognition (ICON) Laboratory specialises in studying the processes underlying human sensorimotor learning and decision-making. Our research takes advantage of the unique capabilities afforded by immersive technologies (virtual and augmented
    reality)- technologies that we believe will transform the study of behavioural science over the next decade.
</p>
<p class="about">
    Our programme lies at the intersection of psychology, computer science and engineerin. We take a multidisciplinary approach towards furthering the scientific understanding of how the systems involved in action execution interact with the neural processes
    that facilitate reinforcement learning and action selection.
</p>
<p class="about">
    We use this fundamental research to help drive forward solutions to real-world problems. Application areas include facilitating surgical performance and informing the development of human-like robot systems, through to developing state-of-art approaches
    for assessing cognitive and sensorimotor capacity for the world-leading <a href="https://borninbradford.nhs.uk">Born In Bradford</a> longitudinal research project housed in the <a href="https://caerbradford.org/">Centre for Applied Education Research</a>.

<p class="about">
    Our research sits at the heart of the University of Leeds's newly established <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/130571/centre_for_immersive_technologies">Centre for Immersive Technologies</a>, with state-of-art AR/VR/XR laboratories. We also benefit
    from the advanced computational infrastructure housed at the <a href="https://lida.leeds.ac.uk">Leeds Institute of Data Analytics</a>and the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7dsP5Q4V18">Wolfson Centre for Applied Health Research</a>.
